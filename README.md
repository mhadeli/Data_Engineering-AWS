# Data Engineering on AWS

## STEDI Project

In the Stedi Project of Udacity's Data Engineering Nanodegree, I leveraged multiple cutting-edge technologies and techniques to construct an end-to-end ETL solution for processing B2B invoices within a highly scalable AWS infrastructure. My approach involved JSON file parsing to convert semi-structured data into tidy relational schemas, Apache Airflow orchestration for controlling job sequences and recovering from failures, AWS VPCs, EC2, RDS, Lambda, and S3 configuration to establish secure, compliant, and cost-efficient settings, security enforcement incorporating encryption, authentication, authorization mechanisms, continuous monitoring, and logging to assure optimal performance and traceability, and finally automated testing to validate output precision against prescribed criteria â€“ all culminating in a battle-tested, future-ready data engineering artifact aligned with today's industrial norms.
